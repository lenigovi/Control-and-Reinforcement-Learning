    "A logic gate is an electronic circuit designed to perform logical operations in digital systems like computers, communication systems, using electronic components like diodes, transistors, resistors, and so on. Logic gates are the building blocks of a digital circuit to execute operations and can take two or more inputs but only produce one output. The output of a logic gate depends on the combination of inputs and the performed logical operation.\n",
